# üì¶ Installation

To install the main client package, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet
```

# üß© Middlewares

Axonet provides a variety of middlewares to augment your HTTP client's functionality. You have the flexibility to selectively install and utilize only the middlewares that are essential for your project. If you require capabilities beyond the provided options, you can create custom middleware and integrate it seamlessly using the `WithMiddleware(priority int, middleware Middleware)` client option.

## Available Middlewares

## Installing Middlewares

To install a specific middleware, use the following command pattern:

```bash
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/{middleware_name}
```

For example, to install the retry middleware:

```bash
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/retry
```

# üöÄ Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the client:

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/retry
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/singleflight
```

Then, use the client in your code:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "time"

    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/retry"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/singleflight"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/pkg/client"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/pkg/client/logger"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new client with middlewares
    c := client.NewClient(
        client.WithMiddleware(2, retry.New(3, 1*time.Second, 5*time.Second)),
        client.WithMiddleware(1, singleflight.New()),
        client.WithLogger(logger.NewBasicLogger()),
    )

    // Make a request
    resp, err := c.NewRequest().
        Method(http.MethodGet).
        URL("https://api.example.com/data").
        Do(context.Background())
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // Process the response...
}
```

# üõ† Configuration

## Client Configuration

You can configure the client with various middlewares when using the `NewClient` function. Here's an example of how to configure multiple middlewares:

```go
import (
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/pkg/client"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/circuitbreaker"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/retry"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/singleflight"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/redis"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/ratelimit"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/proxy"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/cookie"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/header"
)

c := client.NewClient(
    client.WithMiddleware(6, circuitbreaker.New(5, 10*time.Second, 30*time.Second)),
    client.WithMiddleware(5, retry.New(3, 1*time.Second, 5*time.Second)),
    client.WithMiddleware(4, singleflight.New()),
    client.WithMiddleware(3, redis.New(rueidisClient, 5*time.Minute)),
    client.WithMiddleware(2, ratelimit.New(10, 5)),
    client.WithMiddleware(1, proxy.New([]*url.URL{proxyURL1, proxyURL2})),
    client.WithMiddleware(1, cookie.New([][]*http.Cookie{cookies1, cookies2})),
    client.WithMiddleware(1, header.New(http.Header{"User-Agent": {"MyApp/1.0"}})),
    client.WithLogger(logger.NewBasicLogger()),
)
```

## Request Configuration

Individual requests can be configured using the `Request` builder:

```go
type MyRequest struct {
    Key string `json:"key"`
}

type MyResponse struct {
    Data string `json:"data"`
}

var myResult MyResponse

resp, err := c.NewRequest().
    Method(http.MethodPost).
    URL("https://api.example.com/data").
    Query("param1", "value1").
    MarshalBody(MyRequest{Key: "value"}).
    Result(&myResult).
    Do(context.Background())
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer resp.Body.Close()

fmt.Println(myResult.Data)
```

The `Do(ctx context.Context)` method executes the request, automatically marshalling the request body and unmarshaling the response if a result is set.

About some of request configuration:

- `MarshalBody(interface{})`: Automatically marshals the provided struct.
- `MarshalWith(MarshalFunc)`: Sets a custom marshal function for the request body.
- `UnmarshalWith(UnmarshalFunc)`: Sets a custom unmarshal function for the response.
- `Result(interface{})`: Sets the struct to unmarshal the response into.

You can use high-performance JSON libraries like [Sonic](https://github.com/bytedance/sonic) or [go-json](https://github.com/goccy/go-json) for faster marshaling and unmarshaling:

```go
import (
    "github.com/bytedance/sonic"
    "github.com/goccy/go-json"
)

// Using Sonic
c.NewRequest().
    MarshalWith(sonic.Marshal).
    UnmarshalWith(sonic.Unmarshal)

// Using go-json
c.NewRequest().
    MarshalWith(json.Marshal).
    UnmarshalWith(json.Unmarshal)
```

# ‚ùì FAQ

<details>
  <summary><b>Why use axonet over the standard go HTTP package?</b></summary>
  <p>
  Axonet offers several advantages over the standard Go HTTP package:

1. **Middleware System**: Axonet provides a flexible middleware system for easy integration of features like retry logic, circuit breaking, proxies, cookies, redis and rate limiting. With the standard package, you would need to implement these yourself.

2. **Request Building**: Axonet's request builder makes it simpler to construct complex requests, compared to manually setting up requests with the standard package.

3. **Error Handling**: Axonet offers more detailed error types, making it easier to handle specific error scenarios compared to the standard package's more generic errors.

4. **Automatic Marshaling/Unmarshaling**: Axonet can automatically handle JSON marshaling and unmarshaling, which you'd need to do manually with the standard package.

5. **Configurable Logging**: Easy-to-use logging system for debugging, which isn't provided out-of-the-box with the standard package.

6. **Performance Optimizations**: Axonet includes optimizations like request deduplication (via singleflight) and caching (via redis), which aren't available in the standard package.

While the standard Go HTTP package is suitable for most cases, axonet provides a higher-level abstraction that's particularly well-suited for interacting with complex APIs, saving development time and reducing boilerplate code. It is also entirely up to your project's requirements.
