# üöÄ Features

Axonet offers features that prioritize flexibility and reliability. Key features include:

- **Custom Client**
  - Make requests to any website using built-in middlewares.
  - Extend the middlewares to suit your needs.
  - Simple request construction using builders
- **Built-in Middlewares:**
  - [Circuit breaker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/circuit-breaker) for fault tolerance.
  - [Retry mechanism](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/retry) with exponential backoff.
  - [Rate limiting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/rate-limiting-pattern) to prevent API throttling.
  - [Single flight](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/sync/singleflight) to deduplicate concurrent requests.
  - Dynamic proxy rotation for distributed traffic.
  - Cookie-based authentication with rotation.
  - Custom header support for default headers.
- **Easy to Troubleshoot:**
  - Configurable loggers for debugging
  - Detailed error types with root cause

# üì¶ Installation

## Installing Main Client

To install the main client package, use the following command:

```bash
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/pkg/client
```

## Installing Middlewares

Axonet's middlewares are designed to be modular. You can install only the middlewares you need for your project. To install a specific middleware, use the following command pattern:

```bash
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/{middleware_name}
```

For example, to install the retry middleware:

```bash
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/retry
```

Available middlewares:

- circuitbreaker
- cookie
- header
- proxy
- ratelimit
- retry
- singleflight

Install only the middlewares you plan to use in your project to keep your dependencies minimal.

# üöÄ Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use the client:

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/pkg/client
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/retry
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/singleflight
```

Then, use the client in your code:

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "time"

    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/retry"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/singleflight"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/pkg/client"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/pkg/client/logger"
)

func main() {
    // Create a new client with default settings
    c := client.NewClient(
        client.WithMiddleware(retry.New(3, 1*time.Second, 5*time.Second)),
        client.WithMiddleware(singleflight.New()),
        client.WithLogger(logger.NewBasicLogger()),
    )

    // Make a request
    resp, err := c.NewRequest().
        Method(http.MethodGet).
        URL("https://api.example.com/data").
        Do(context.Background())

    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // Process the response...
}
```

# üõ† Configuration

## Client Configuration

The client can be configured with various middlewares when using the `NewClient` function. First, install the desired middleware packages:

```bash
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/circuitbreaker
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/retry
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/ratelimit
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/singleflight
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/proxy
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/cookie
go get github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/header
```

Then, configure the client:

```go
import (
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/pkg/client"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/circuitbreaker"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/cookie"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/header"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/proxy"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/ratelimit"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/retry"
    "github.com/jaxron/axonet/middleware/singleflight"
)

client := client.NewClient(
  client.WithMiddleware(circuitbreaker.New(5, 10*time.Second, 30*time.Second)),
    client.WithMiddleware(cookie.New([][]*http.Cookie{cookies1, cookies2})),
    client.WithMiddleware(header.New(http.Header{"User-Agent": {"MyApp/1.0"}})),
    client.WithMiddleware(proxy.New([]*url.URL{proxyURL1, proxyURL2})),
    client.WithMiddleware(ratelimit.New(10, 5)),
    client.WithMiddleware(retry.New(3, 1*time.Second, 5*time.Second)),
    client.WithMiddleware(singleflight.New()),
    client.WithLogger(logger.NewBasicLogger()),
)
```

You can add or remove middlewares as needed for your specific use case. You can also add custom middleware using the `WithMiddleware(middleware Middleware)` option if you need to extend the functionality beyond what is provided.

## Request Configuration

Individual requests can be configured using the `Request` builder:

```go
type MyRequest struct {
    Key string `json:"key"`
}

type MyResponse struct {
    Data string `json:"data"`
}

var myResult MyResponse

resp, err := c.NewRequest().
    Method(http.MethodPost).
    URL("https://api.example.com/data").
    Query("param1", "value1").
    Header("Content-Type", "application/json").
    MarshalBody(MyRequest{Key: "value"}).
    Result(&myResult).
    Do(context.Background())

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer resp.Body.Close()

fmt.Println(myResult.Data)
```

About some of request configuration:

- `MarshalBody(interface{})`: Automatically marshals the provided struct.
- `MarshalWith(MarshalFunc)`: Sets a custom marshal function for the request body.
- `UnmarshalWith(UnmarshalFunc)`: Sets a custom unmarshal function for the response.
- `Result(interface{})`: Sets the struct to unmarshal the response into.

You can use high-performance JSON libraries like [Sonic](https://github.com/bytedance/sonic) or [go-json](https://github.com/goccy/go-json) for faster marshaling and unmarshaling:

```go
import (
    "github.com/bytedance/sonic"
    "github.com/goccy/go-json"
)

// Using Sonic
client.NewRequest().
    MarshalWith(sonic.Marshal).
    UnmarshalWith(sonic.Unmarshal)

// Using go-json
client.NewRequest().
    MarshalWith(json.Marshal).
    UnmarshalWith(json.Unmarshal)
```

The `Do(ctx context.Context)` method executes the request, automatically marshalling the request body and unmarshalling the response if a result is set.
